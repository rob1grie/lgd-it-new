					<h3 class="page_title"> About Us</h3>
					<div class="page_content">
						<p class="pad_bottom">LGD Services was originally formed to provide IT and website services to churches and non-profits, 
							but after visiting with church offices in the area I learned that most - if not all - had someone in 
							their congregation already serving in that capacity. Then it dawned on me ... why should I be trying to 
							"make a buck" off of God's Church?</p>
						<p>That's when I changed my focus to supporting small businesses and homes, offering my services and experience 
							to those that preferred not to pay "Geek Squad" prices. My conscientious work ethic, personable attitude, 
							and affordable pricing were all it took for my customers to then let me prove my skills and knowledge in 
							solving their IT and website needs.</p>
						<h4 class="blue"> Why Choose Us</h4>
						<p>I'll let my customers speak for me:</p>
						<blockquote>
							Rob is a member of your team. I looked high and low for someone to help me design my web page. 
							Rob was referred to me by a coworker. We connected and he listened to what I desired for my web 
							site. He included me in every step. I love my web page and I thank God for sending this talented 
							young man my way. If you are looking for excellent service and fair pricing go see Rob.  
							<p> <small><b>Lady J</b> - A happy customer</small></p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							LGD makes you visible in the community 24hrs a day. 
							Tech support for your office as well as high visibility in your community. <br>
							From our small church planting, low budget days, meeting in a school, till this very [day], LGD

							we've ever used!<br>

							Powerful tool for our staff!
